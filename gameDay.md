## Project Description

The project aims to provide coaches and players a convenient way to analyze, understand, and improve their performance, both in game and during practice. This project will be the first step in creating a platform for high school coaches and sports players, with the goal of expanding to other interests in the future.

We plan on first developing the app focused around football and hopefully expand to other activities if the app proves useful.
